    "text": "Introduction\nIn October 2023, Hospital El Carmen in MaipÃº implemented a new positionâ€”the Ambulatory Process Coordinatorâ€”in the Adult Emergency Department. This role, held by a certified emergency physician, was introduced to streamline patient flow and ensure that clinical decisions (admission, discharge, referral) were made within 6 hours of admission.\nThis study evaluates the causal effect of the intervention on the average time from medical evaluation to discharge using a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), taking advantage of the sharp assignment around the implementation date (October 22, 2023).\n\n\nMethods\n\nStudy Design\nA sharp Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) was used. The cutoff date for intervention was October 22, 2023. The estimating equation is as follows:\n\\[\nY_i = \\alpha + \\tau D_i + f(x_i) + \\varepsilon_i\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\((Y_i)\\): outcome for individual i, defined as time from medical evaluation to discharge (in minutes),\n\n\\((D_i = 1)\\) if \\((x_i \\geq 0)\\) (post-intervention), 0 otherwise,\n\n\\((f(x_i))\\): flexible function (e.g., local linear) of the running variable x,\n\n\\((\\tau )\\): treatment effect of interest (impact of the intervention),\n\n\\((\\varepsilon\\_i)\\): error term.\n\nWe employ local polynomial regressions with robust bias correction and optimal bandwidth selection using the rdrobust package in R. Models are estimated for bandwidths ranging from Â±30 to Â±365 days.\n\n\nData and Variable Construction\n\nOutcome: Time to medical discharge (in minutes), computed from h:m:s timestamp strings.\n\nRunning variable: Days from October 22, 2023.\n\nFilters: Exclude extreme values (&lt;0 or &gt;1000 min); jitter applied (Â±0.001) to avoid mass points.\n\nSeasonality: Adjusted via STL decomposition and categorical regression on week-of-year.\n\n\n\n\nResults\nThis Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) graph evaluates the causal effect of an intervention (e.g., the arrival of a specialist physician) on emergency department performance, specifically, the time from medical evaluation to discharge (measured in minutes).\nThe red line represents a smoothed local polynomial regression on either side of the threshold (the vertical black line at day 0), and blue dots with error bars show binned average outcomes with their confidence intervals.\n\nRegression Equation and Definitions\nThe estimating equation used in this Regression Discontinuity Design is:\n\\[\nY_i = \\alpha + \\tau D_i + f(x_i) + \\varepsilon_i\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n( Y_i ): Outcome for individual i, defined as time from medical evaluation to discharge (in minutes).\n\n( D_i ): Treatment indicator, equal to 1 if day ( x_i ) (post-intervention), 0 otherwise.\n\n( f(x_i) ): Smooth function of the running variable (days relative to intervention).\n\n( ): Average treatment effect at the cutoff (causal impact of intervention).\n\n( _i ): Error term, assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Impact of an emergency physician on time from medical evaluation to discharge, RDD (Â±60-day window)\n\n\n\nRDD Plot\n\n\nThere appears to be a discrete drop in the average time from medical evaluation to discharge immediately after the intervention, suggesting a potential causal reduction in care delays following the specialistâ€™s arrival.\nThe pattern before the intervention shows relatively higher variability and higher averages, while the post-intervention period exhibits a decline in both mean time and variation.\nThis visual discontinuity supports the hypothesis that specialist integration into ED operations has a positive efficiency impact.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis RDD analysis reveals a significant and immediate reduction in discharge time following the implementation of the process coordinator role. While the absolute decrease may seem modest in minutes, the cumulative effect becomes substantial in the context of a high-volume ED.\nThe findings suggest that incorporating a dedicated coordinator can enhance operational efficiency by:\n\nStreamlining case prioritization\n\nReducing backlogs\n\nImproving interdisciplinary communication\n\nThese results provide support for the adoption and scaling of similar roles in comparable hospital settings.\nHowever, limitations include:\n\nPotential unobserved co-interventions\n\nSingle-hospital context, limiting generalizability\n\n\n\nFuture Directions\n\nReplicate across multiple hospitals and systems.\n\nAssess additional outcomes (e.g., mortality, readmissions, patient satisfaction).\n\nIncorporate qualitative assessments of staff and patient experience.\n\nApply staggered rollout designs or multi-site trials for better causal identification."

    "text": "Emergency Department (ED) crowding is a growing concern in healthcare systems worldwide, including Chile, where public health services serve over 80% of the population. In response to rising demand and to reduce unnecessary emergency department (ED) visits, the Chilean Ministry of Health has implemented Urgent Primary Care Centres (SAPUs) and, more recently, High-Resolution Urgent Care Centres (SARs), which operate extended hours and provide enhanced diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities. Since their inception, more than 100 SARs have been established across the country over the past two decades.\nChileâ€™s public health system (80% of population) is organized into 29 regional Health Services (Servicios de Salud), each responsible for coordinating care delivery within its territory. This example study focuses on the Servicio de Salud Metropolitano Central (SSMC), one of the largest and most urbanized networks, located in Santiago. Specifically, it evaluates the effect of implementing two SARsâ€”SAR Enfermera SofÃ­a Pincheira (opened on September 15, 2016) and SAR Michelle Bachelet (opened on August 13, 2024)â€”on daily emergency care utilization rates per 1,000 inhabitants. The analysis uses neighboring health services as counterfactuals to estimate the impact of these interventions within the SSMC.\n\n\n\nData are derived from administrative records of the REM 08 - Urgent Care Records, reported by the Department of Health Statistics and Information (DEIS), which cover all urgent care visits across public facilities in Chile. The study population includes all adult urgent care visits in the SSMC network and selected comparison networks.\nA difference-in-differences (DiD) design was employed to estimate the causal effect of SAR implementation on the daily emergency department (ED) utilization rate per 1,000 inhabitants. This crude model included indicators for the treated area (treated), the post-intervention period (periododespues), and their interaction (treated:periododespues), which captures the DiD estimate.\nThe outcomes were modeled using ordinary least squares (OLS), assuming independent and identically distributed (IID) errors.\n\n\n\nLet \\((Y\\_{it})\\) denote the outcome variableâ€”the daily emergency department (ED) visit rate per 1,000 inhabitantsâ€”for health service i on day t.\nThe DiD regression model is specified as:\n\\[\nY_{it} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{Treated}_i + \\beta_2 \\text{Post}_t + \\beta_3 (\\text{Treated}_i \\times \\text{Post}_t) + \\varepsilon_{it}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\nTreatedi is a binary indicator equal to 1 if the observation belongs to the treated health service (SSMC), and 0 otherwise.\nPostt is a binary indicator equal to 1 for observations after the SAR implementation date, and 0 otherwise.\nTreatedi Ã— Postt is the interaction term that captures the difference-in-differences estimator.\nÎ²â‚ƒ is the DiD estimate of the causal effect of the SAR implementation.\nÎµit is the error term, assumed to be IID.\n\nTo support this assumption, we selected comparison health services using the MAD in daily rates prior to intervention. The unit of analysis was the daily ED rate per 1,000 inhabitants, aggregated by health service.\nWe used symmetric 360-day windows before and after the intervention. No other major policy disruptions or new urgent care centres were introduced during the study periods, minimizing the risk of confounding shocks. By incorporating a contemporaneous control group, the DiD model adjusts for time-varying factors such as seasonality, public health campaigns, or social unrest. The large sample size (N &gt; 21,000) and the use of national standardized data (REM A-08) enhance the robustness and generalizability of the results.\n\n\n\nTo identify the most appropriate control services, I calculated the Mean Absolute Difference (MAD) in daily ED rates between SSMC and all other services over the 360 days preceding the intervention.\n\nFor SAR SofÃ­a Pincheira, the Servicio de Salud Metropolitano Sur Oriente (SSMSO) presented the lowest MAD (0.243) and was selected as the control.\nFor SAR Michelle Bachelet, the same control (SSMSO, MAD = 0.251) was used, given its comparability and proximity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiD estimates from the Â±360-day window:\n\n\n\nVariable\nEstimate\nStd.

    "text": "Appendix 2: Exploring the Reasons Behind Leaving Without Being Seen (LWBS)\n\nIntroduction\nTo understand the motivations, barriers, and contextual factors that influence a patientâ€™s decision to leave the Emergency Department (ED) before being evaluated by a medical professional.\n\n\nMethods\nThis sub-study will employ a qualitative exploratory design, utilizing semi-structured interviews with patients who left the ED without being seen (LWBS). The goal is to capture in-depth perspectives on the social, systemic, and personal factors that contribute to the decision to leave before undergoing medical evaluation.\n\n\nStudy Design and Setting\nThe study will be conducted in selected public hospitals in urban and semi-urban areas of Chile with high ED volumes and a documented proportion of LWBS cases. Recruitment will focus on sites within the national public health system (FONASA), ensuring relevance to the broader population served.\n\n\nParticipant Selection\nParticipants will be recruited through purposive sampling, focusing on individuals who recently left the ED without being seen. Recruitment will be conducted via telephone contact, using ED visit records from a representative sample of public hospital EDs across each Servicio de Salud in Chile.\nInclusion criteria:\n\nAge 18 or older\n\nDocumented an LWBS event within the last 30 days\n\nWillingness and ability to provide informed consent\n\n\n\nData Collection\nSemi-structured interviews will be conducted in person or via telephone by trained interviewers using a guide developed from the literature and expert input. The guide will explore:\n\nExpectations and experiences before leaving\n\nPerceived waiting times and communication\n\nStructural barriers (e.g., transport, childcare, costs)\n\nTrust in the system and prior experiences\n\nPerceptions of urgency and safety\n\nInterviews will be audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and anonymised.\n\n\nData Analysis\nTranscripts will be analysed using thematic analysis following Braun and Clarkeâ€™s six-step framework. Coding will be both inductive and deductive. NVivo or similar software will support analysis.\nTriangulation will include:\n\nIndependent coding by two researchers\n\nFeedback from patient representatives and ED clinicians during interpretation\n\n\n\nEthical Considerations\nThe study will be approved by an accredited ethics committee in Chile. Informed consent will be obtained. Confidentiality and voluntary participation will be guaranteed.\n\n\n\nInterview Guide (Questionnaire)\nInstructions for Interviewers:\n\nEnsure informed consent has been obtained before beginning the interview.\n\nInterview in a quiet and private setting when possible.\n\nUse probing questions as needed to elicit detailed responses.\n\nRecord the interview (if permitted) or take detailed notes.\n\n\nSection 1: Patient Profile\n\nAge:\n\nGender:\n\nPlace of residence (commune/neighborhood):\n\nHealth insurance type:\n\nOccupation:\n\nHave you previously visited this ED? (Yes/No)\n\nHave you left an ED without being seen before? (Yes/No)\n\n\n\nSection 2: Visit Context\n\nWhat brought you to the Emergency Department on the day in question?\n\nWhat symptoms or concerns were you experiencing?\n\nAt what time did you arrive at the ED?\n\nHow long did you wait before deciding to leave?\n\nWere you triaged by a nurse or healthcare professional? (Yes/No)\n\nDid you receive any information about your expected waiting time? (Yes/No)\n\n\n\nSection 3: Reasons for Leaving\n\nWhat were your main reasons for deciding to leave the ED?\n\nDid you feel your health concern was no longer urgent?\n\nWere there specific aspects of the waiting experience that influenced your decision (e.g., overcrowding, discomfort, lack of communication)?\n\nDid you try to speak with the staff before leaving? Why or why not?\n\nDid anyone accompany you to the ED, and did they influence your decision to leave?\n\n\n\nSection 4: After Leaving the ED\n\nDid you seek medical care elsewhere after leaving?\n\nDid your condition improve, worsen, or remain the same?\n\nIn hindsight, do you believe leaving the ED was the right decision? Why or why not?\n\n\n\nSection 5: Suggestions for Improvement\n\nWhat could the hospital or staff have done differently to help you stay and receive care?\n\nDo you have suggestions to improve the experience for patients waiting in the ED?\n\nClosing Remarks:\nThank the participants for their time and insights. Remind them of the importance of their contribution to improving emergency care services."
