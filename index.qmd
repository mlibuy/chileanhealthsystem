# Welcome

This website presents a selection of applied research projects and analyses I've developed around the Chilean public healthcare system.  
My work explores urgent care saturation, hospital capacity planning, and the role of primary and emergency services in improving system performance.

## Explore the sections

- [Urgent Clinics impact in healthcare networks](urgent-clinics.html)  
  Evaluation of the impact of new primary urgent care centers (SAPU, SAR) on emergency department demand and network efficiency.

- [Emergency medicine physician impact in emergency department timeframes](physician-impact.html)  
  Causal analyses (RDD and ITS) on how emergency medicine physicians influence wait times, throughput, and patient outcomes.

- [Bed estimation](bed-estimation.html)  
  Forecasting hospital bed needs by level of care and health service using adjusted formula-based models and avoidable hospitalizations.

## About me

I'm a Chilean physician specialized in public health and epidemiology. I earned my MD at the University of Chile and later completed an MSc in Epidemiology and Public Health at University College London in the United Kingdom.

Currently, I serve as Head of the Adult Emergency Department at Hospital El Carmen de MaipÃº. I also lecture in health policy and management at the School of Public Health at University of Chile.

My professional focus combines clinical leadership and applied research. I've worked as a consultant for the World Bank, IDB, PAHO/WHO, and the Chilean Ministry of Health on topics such as hospital efficiency, financing, and system modernization.
