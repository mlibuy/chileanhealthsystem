    "text": "Emergency Department (ED) crowding is a growing concern in healthcare systems worldwide, including Chile, where public health services serve over 80% of the population. In response to rising demand and to reduce unnecessary emergency department (ED) visits, the Chilean Ministry of Health has implemented Urgent Primary Care Centres (SAPUs) and, more recently, High-Resolution Urgent Care Centres (SARs), which operate extended hours and provide enhanced diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities. Since their inception, more than 100 SARs have been established across the country over the past two decades.\nChileâ€™s public health system (80% of population) is organized into 29 regional Health Services (Servicios de Salud), each responsible for coordinating care delivery within its territory. This example study focuses on the Servicio de Salud Metropolitano Central (SSMC), one of the largest and most urbanized networks, located in Santiago. Specifically, it evaluates the effect of implementing two SARsâ€”SAR Enfermera SofÃ­a Pincheira (opened on September 15, 2016) and SAR Michelle Bachelet (opened on August 13, 2024)â€”on daily emergency care utilization rates per 1,000 inhabitants. The analysis uses neighboring health services as counterfactuals to estimate the impact of these interventions within the SSMC.\n\n\n\nData are derived from administrative records of the REM 08 - Urgent Care Records, reported by the Department of Health Statistics and Information (DEIS), which cover all urgent care visits across public facilities in Chile. The study population includes all adult urgent care visits in the SSMC network and selected comparison networks.\nA difference-in-differences (DiD) design was employed to estimate the causal effect of SAR implementation on the daily emergency department (ED) utilization rate per 1,000 inhabitants. This crude model included indicators for the treated area (treated), the post-intervention period (periododespues), and their interaction (treated:periododespues), which captures the DiD estimate.\nThe outcomes were modeled using ordinary least squares (OLS), assuming independent and identically distributed (IID) errors.\n\n\n\nLet \\( Y_{it} \\) denote the outcome variableâ€”the daily emergency department (ED) visit rate per 1,000 inhabitantsâ€”for health service i on day t.\nThe DiD regression crude model is specified as:\n[ Y_{it} = _0 + _1 _i + _2 _t + _3 (_i t) + ]\nWhere:\n\nTreatedi is a binary indicator equal to 1 if the observation belongs to the treated health service (SSMC), and 0 otherwise.\nPostt is a binary indicator equal to 1 for observations after the SAR implementation date, and 0 otherwise.\nTreatedi Ã— Postt is the interaction term that captures the difference-in-differences estimator.\nÎ²â‚ƒ is the DiD estimate of the causal effect of the SAR implementation.\nÎµit is the error term, assumed to be IID.\n\nTo support this assumption, we selected comparison health services using the MAD in daily rates prior to intervention. The unit of analysis was the daily ED rate per 1,000 inhabitants, aggregated by health service.\nWe used symmetric 360-day windows before and after the intervention. No other major policy disruptions or new urgent care centres were introduced during the study periods, minimizing the risk of confounding shocks. By incorporating a contemporaneous control group, the DiD model adjusts for time-varying factors such as seasonality, public health campaigns, or social unrest. The large sample size (N &gt; 21,000) and the use of national standardized data (REM A-08) enhance the robustness and generalizability of the results.\n\n\n\nTo identify the most appropriate control services, I calculated the Mean Absolute Difference (MAD) in daily ED rates between SSMC and all other services over the 360 days preceding the intervention.\n\nFor SAR SofÃ­a Pincheira, the Servicio de Salud Metropolitano Sur Oriente (SSMSO) presented the lowest MAD (0.243) and was selected as the control.\nFor SAR Michelle Bachelet, the same control (SSMSO, MAD = 0.251) was used, given its comparability and proximity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiD estimates from the Â±360-day window:\n\n\n\nVariable\nEstimate\nStd.
